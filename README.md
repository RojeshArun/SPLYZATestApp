# SPLYZATestApp

Instructions

1. Start with a Home screen with a simple “Invite” button in the center. Tapping the “Invite”
   button should open this view.
2. Complete the above app screen, paying close attention to the functional requirements.
   Code organization, separation of concerns, testability, and completeness will be
   thoroughly reviewed.
3. Assume the APIs will always return a successful response. Since there is no actual API
   available for testing, mock the responses to randomly cycle through each of the
   scenarios laid out in the specifications each time the view is opened.
4. Add automated UI testing using Espresso.
5. Unit testing is not required but is encouraged.
6. Please submit as a Git repository.
7. Design (colors, font sizes, etc) correctness will not be strictly enforced.
